# Prototype Instructions

Run the local server yourself and open the preview in the browser available to this environment. Do not give the user server-start instructions when you can run it.

Before making substantial visual changes, use the Product Design plugin's `get-context` skill when the visual source is unclear or no longer matches the current goal. When the user gives durable prototype-specific design feedback, preferences, or decisions, record them in `AGENTS.md`.

When implementing from a selected generated mock, treat that image as the source of truth for layout, component anatomy, density, spacing, color, typography, visible content, and hierarchy.

Build app UI in `src/`. Keep `.openai/hosting.json`, `worker/index.js`, `scripts/prepare-sites-build.mjs`, and `tests/sites-worker.test.mjs` intact so the same local prototype can be handed to Sites. Before a Sites handoff, run `npm run build` and `npm run test:sites`; the build must leave `dist/client/index.html`, `dist/server/index.js`, and `dist/.openai/hosting.json`.

## Approved product direction

### Parliamentary intelligence update — 17 September 2026

Tomas requested continued real AI processing, broad parliamentary ingestion, politician vote histories, source-based investigation of position changes, and a clear distinction between current proceedings and historical votes. The new Parliament view uses real official OData imports. Never interpret missing vote records as abstentions, current party membership as historical membership, or procedural text carrying a chair ID as their speech. Comparisons require reviewed role and proposal-version context; no automatic hypocrisy or integrity score. See `../docs/research/PARLIAMENT-INTELLIGENCE-UPDATE.md`.

### User direction update — voice and Swiss branding, 17 September 2026

Tomas selected https://heyaristotle.com/ as the design reference: immersive illustration, warm serif typography, a personable conversational experience and a counter-trend feel. Translate that direction into distinctly Swiss figures, symbols, history and regional details. Keep source panels readable and professional across mobile and desktop. Voice and text should share one evidence-backed conversation, with explicit canton selection for future local ballot discovery. ElevenLabs Creator access is user-reported for three free months; verify the actual Agents/API entitlement. See `../docs/archive/2026-09/VOICE-AND-SWISS-BRAND-PLAN.md` for the historical implementation order and `../docs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md` for current direction. This is a durable approved direction; the current interface has not yet been reskinned or given speech support.

### User-approved implementation — 17 September 2026

Build Midnight Vote — Swiss Pilot as the responsive default experience, preserving the existing application at `/legacy`. Use restrained Swiss editorial styling, ivory backgrounds, generous spacing and muted red accents. Citizens are primary, with explicit Research view available on mobile and desktop. Five historical voting dossiers, anonymous reading, ordinary Supabase accounts and source-linked AI actions are approved. Optional private identity remains a clearly labelled concept until core acceptance passes. Official explainers must never be labelled parliamentary debate recordings; distinguish publisher captions, editorial summaries and machine processing. These decisions supersede the older dark desktop-first prototype direction below for the pilot.

### User direction update — 14 September 2026

The user has shifted the next product cycle toward a simple citizen journey in a responsive web app, with desktop evidence inspection, federal popular votes first and local ballots later. Public information remains accessible without passport verification; proposed verified participation stays non-binding. See `../docs/README.md` and `../docs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md` for research, acceptance criteria and open decisions. Current work is documentation, not an approved replacement visual layout. The older desktop-first audience/journey preferences below describe the existing prototype and must not override this newer user direction. Keep exact navigation and provider choices open until the relevant implementation specification is settled.

### Existing prototype reference

- Desktop-first, dark, evidence-centered interface based on `design/approved-conversational-briefing.png`.
- Dashboard is the default home and the first navigation item. It summarizes tracked proposals, upcoming parliamentary activity, recent evidence, and voting context.
- Keep the default Ask experience simple; advanced research controls belong behind the Investigate mode.
- Ask Parliament opens directly on the question composer. Do not repeat an Ask/Investigate mode switch inside that screen because both destinations already exist in persistent navigation.
- Original parliamentary video, transcript, and source metadata must remain visually primary over AI interpretation.
- The source sidebar includes a compact "Speakers in this debate" portrait list directly below "About this source".
- The core demo journey is Dashboard → Ask → cited source → full Debate → Investigate → Proposal Tracker.
- Personalization is explicit: people, parties, proposals, and topics are items the user chooses to follow. Never infer or label a user's political affiliation.
- The dashboard greeting uses the account display name, falling back to "Citizen". Settings owns this preference along with language, notifications, and privacy controls.
- Calendar is a first-class workspace. Each event is selectable and opens an adjacent detail inspector with an action to open the related debate/proposal or create an alert.
- Alerts are monitoring rules created from explicit filters or a natural-language prompt. AI suggestions are always rendered as editable chips before a rule is saved.
- Investigate's AI filter builder is assistive only: it proposes period, level, type, topic, and chamber filters for review before search.
- Prototype screens consume one normalized fixture model so that debate IDs, people, timestamps, proposal stages, and citations remain consistent and can later be replaced by API responses.
- Keep persistence temporary and explicit: `usePersistentState`/localStorage is only for demo continuity; production preferences, follows, alerts, history, and saved research must come from the authenticated backend.
- Keep network access behind `src/services/api.js` (`createApiClient`). Screens should consume a provider rather than calling `fetch` directly so fixtures can be replaced by the real API without a UI rewrite.

### Cleisthenes update — 17 September 2026

The assistant is named Cleisthenes, with an original friendly Greek-inspired illustrated avatar. User requests an always-available bottom-right compact chat, expandable into its own page, fewer competing controls, visual support and an Apple-like restrained finish within the Swiss / Hey Aristotle direction. Keep source details progressively disclosed and preserve chat when expanded. Continue current-session ingestion, multilingual retrieval, speed and genuine parliamentary-video alignment. Stance-change work is explicitly paused; hide its controls. Voice is still a later integration. The new avatar is a generated raster asset at `public/images/cleisthenes.png`.

### Profile and retrieval feedback — 17 September 2026

Tomas wants varied questions to select relevant checked sources, particularly party-background follow-ups after a politician’s speech. Keep official profile fields, party self-description and personal parliamentary statements distinct. Provide official portraits, declared background, dated individual votes, and verified professional contacts. AI correspondence is an editable draft with an email-app handoff; never send automatically. Use concise About / Votes / Write sections, paginate long voting histories, and state import coverage. Do not infer personal ideology or restart stance-change analysis.

### UX refinement — 17 September 2026
Use Parliament / Dossiers / Saved as destinations; Research is a dossier-level mode, not a duplicate main navigation item. All AI entry cards open the same contextual Cleisthenes chat with visible source scope and a focused composer. Avoid permanent flagship shortcuts in general directories. Style disclosure panels, segmented choices, inputs and buttons using the shared cream, muted-red and rounded-surface language. Appllama's Craft New Chat pattern informed the context label, suggestion chips and clear composer; retain original Swiss branding.

### Reader-first update — 17 September 2026
Use Topics & votes / Thèmes et votations in the navigation. People seek documents, subjects, speakers and statements; use Read the debate as the search entry. Always show matching text even without timed video. Keep experimental image similarity in advanced tools. Official portraits and canton/chamber context belong in profiles. Never replace an empty AI answer with a generic coverage disclaimer. See `../docs/archive/2026-09/TOPICS-AND-READER-ROADMAP.md` for the historical roadmap and `../docs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md` for current direction.

### Conversation and citation feedback — 18 September 2026
Use short topic chips rather than full-question suggestion cards; selecting one prepares an editable prompt. Keep one concise AI/source note in the chat footer. Remove the generic all-imported-evidence banner and repeated provider labels; retain a concise label for an explicit person/proposal/passage scope and recorded replay status. Preserve conversations across navigation, expansion/collapse and reload. Recent chats may be stored on-device for this pilot, clearly labelled with delete controls; do not imply account sync. Citations open a separate source inspector with original context, official portrait when available, dated speaker/role information, proposal context, bounded video start/end when actually aligned, and editable follow-up questions. Never invent timings or portraits to fill missing coverage.

### Contextual research feedback — 18 September 2026
Keep original debate words visible with in-place translation and a target-language choice. Highlight query terms, tolerate accents/plurals and small spelling errors, and disclose fuzzy matches. Require meaningful terms together, not OR matches on generic words. Source actions must open Cleisthenes scoped to the selected passage with the research query in the editable prompt. Show both video boundaries and stop playback at the end. Visual image similarity is never evidence of spoken subject matter. Synthetic translation audio must be labelled separately from original recordings; ElevenLabs app access is not configured yet.

### Approved Greek–Swiss integration — 18 September 2026
Use the finalized Civic Companion Design Lovable project dfabf414-608e-48cf-a632-e32b28e67c17 and the local brand-exploration/BRANDBOOK.md plus REVISION-02.md. Warm rag paper #F3EDDF, ink #252823, limestone #D9CBB4, lake #7E9BA5, sage #87907A, terracotta #A24F40; Source Serif 4 headings and IBM Plex Sans UI. Preserve the portico, Swiss landscape, original mascot and scroll sequence at the entry. Use restrained editorial layouts for research, clear source types and functioning reading preferences. Landing demos must route to live features; eligibility proofs and community voting must not appear operational. The canonical proposed public mount is /Switzerland/; the existing midnight.vote root site and API must remain separate. See `../docs/archive/2026-09/GREEK-SWISS-INTEGRATION.md` for the historical integration record and `../docs/PRODUCT-SPEC.md` for current direction.

### Landing demos — 18 September 2026
The user explicitly requested interactive simulations in all three landing chapters: quote/timestamp/translation research; a polished phone showing selective eligibility proofs (Swiss citizen, 18+, optional canton) with the real Midnight Network SVG; and a scripted Cleisthenes discussion leading to a simulated community vote with a fingerprint confirmation. This supersedes the earlier instruction to replace demos with static live-feature cards. Clearly label fictional words/timing and future proof/voting flows; do not access identity data, biometrics or a network transaction. Keep a path into the real app. Blend the closing message into the Geneva artwork without a hard horizontal seam.

### Accepted civic workspace — 18 September 2026
Implement Home / Parliament / Topics / Saved. The in-app wordmark and landing entry open Home; About retains the landing. Keep the Greek–Swiss brand. Replace Reading / Research with one Overview / Debate / Timeline / Sources workspace and preserve selected research during navigation. Personalisation is explicit follows and optional canton only. New signed-in chats sync; anonymous chats remain local and import is opt-in.

The first chamber release MUST remain 2D. Use the official interactive SVG desk geometry and stable member IDs, separate NR (200) and SR (46), party and parliamentary-group identifiers, immutable dated snapshots, and complete legends including every one-seat party and independents. Never produce a generic semicircle, merge small parties, duplicate the presiding member, or invent a vacancy. Preserve the previous validated snapshot on failed import. Production website deployment is a separate release step.

### Speaker context and branch safety — 18 September 2026
Citations should offer an inline expandable video, with exact aligned quotes distinguished from the full intervention. Never promise timings for unavailable/unverified recordings. About the speaker includes sourced career history, canton, party and separate group, with prominent navigation to our shareable profile and recorded votes. Official biography links must open the human-readable Parliament page, not raw OData. Current term start must not be presented as first entry into politics. Commit/push only to the local pilot branch and Tomas's fork; never upstream or main. Backup activation remains unapproved; explain privileged access in plain language before any approval request.

### Real landing and feedback — 18 September 2026
Replace the fictional research walkthrough with an actual processed official recording, original quotation and labelled translation. Keep copy brief. Privacy/voting simulations stay labelled concepts. Feedback explicitly routes to contact@midnight.vote with spam controls; never attach chat history or private account context. Public corpus backups/indexing must remain separate from user data.

### Account entry and chatbot audit — 18 September 2026
Get started opens a clean Greek–Swiss account dialog while preserving the landing artwork and demos. (Superseded 24 Sep 2026: beyond the landing page the app is for verified accounts whenever the server's ACCESS_POLICY is not `open`; see the section below.) Social and organization sign-in must reflect real provider configuration; never present adapter support as activated authentication. The requested competitor chatbot review is analysis only: do not apply its chat proposals without a subsequent implementation request.

### Account and Home refinement — 19 September 2026
Keep account entry concise: one heading, email sign-up first, then the existing-account link, then social and organization methods. Collect a display name for a personalized Home welcome and confirmation email. A successful sign-up replaces the form with a dedicated full-dialog inbox state, including a path to sign in after verification. Production confirmation and recovery links must return to `https://midnight.vote/Switzerland/api/auth/callback`; never ship a localhost Site URL. Home begins with `Welcome, [Name]`, removes the former civic-workspace eyebrow and descriptive slogan, and provides a direct Cleisthenes composer. In Parliament may show a compact chamber preview only from the verified official seating snapshot. Calendar day selection opens an adjacent detail popover and must not filter or replace the In Parliament list. Use previous/next arrows for month navigation and a custom month chooser from the centered month label rather than the native month control.

### Landing navigation alignment — 19 September 2026
Keep the desktop logo, centered exploration links and Get started action in three aligned columns. Navigation links use readable UI text and generous click targets. Preserve the existing artwork, scroll behavior and mobile logo/CTA layout.

### Passwordless clarification — 19 September 2026
The user meant email magic links when requesting SSO. Remove organization SSO from account entry; default the landing dialog to passwordless email and retain password access for existing users. Use branded midnight.vote authentication emails. Apple remains disabled until a Developer membership exists. Google and Discord must reflect actual provider activation, not adapter availability.

### Personal account dashboard — 19 September 2026
Use preferred first names for greetings and account controls. Saved research belongs in Home and account settings, not the main navbar. Settings has Profile, Appearance, Security, Privacy and Advanced sections, with warm Greek–Swiss styling, readable type and generous space. Avatar edits require explicit Save. Security controls must use real provider state: TOTP is enabled only after code verification, with protected account APIs and restrictive database assurance policy. Do not invent backup codes or final legal/operator details. Apple stays disabled without membership; organization SSO is out of scope.

### One agenda and follow-up feedback — 23 September 2026
Tomas found the Home "In Parliament" list and separate Calendar confusing (clicking one panel changed the other, too many clicks). This supersedes the 19 September calendar-popover decision: Home shows one Parliament agenda card where a single month control and date strip drive a single list, items expand inline, and one click asks Cleisthenes a fitting question that sends immediately (what happened / what is planned). Upcoming sessions are answered honestly as not yet held, with labelled web research when configured. Suggested follow-ups must stay answerable from the record and continue the answer's proposal scope; the featured evidence card must stay in sync with citation chips. Web findings always sit in a separate "Beyond the parliamentary record" block. Use the terracotta accent for primary actions.

## 24 September 2026 — verified accounts only

Answers now run on a paid model (OpenAI gpt-6-luna), so the app is no longer open to anonymous readers. The server's `ACCESS_POLICY` (`open` | `paid` | `verified`, reported by `/api/health`) decides; the shell follows it without a rebuild. Beyond the landing page, anonymous readers get the account dialog and unverified accounts get the Verify-your-email step. "Explore without an account" appears only when the policy is `open`. Sign-in offers email link, password, Google and Discord (Apple is dropped). Each verified account has a daily and weekly question allowance (`ASK_DAILY_LIMIT`, `ASK_WEEKLY_LIMIT`); prepared answers don't count. Show limit errors with their reset time, never as a model failure.
