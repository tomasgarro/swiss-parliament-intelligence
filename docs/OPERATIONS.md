# Operations and deployment

This is the canonical runbook for the Swiss pilot runtime. It consolidates the former dated runbooks and release notes; those originals remain in the historical archive.

## Runtime layout

| Layer | Implementation |
| --- | --- |
| Browser | React 19 / Vite civic workspace mounted under `/Switzerland/` in production. |
| Application API | Node.js server on port 4318 with built-in SQLite, server-managed sessions and explicit JSON endpoints. |
| Public corpus | `parliament.sqlite`, `public-processing.sqlite`, `public-embeddings.sqlite`, selected public media and alignment receipts. |
| Private application data | Supabase Auth plus per-user rows; separate from public corpus packaging and backups. |
| GPU services | Nemotron on remote loopback 30081, Riva Translate on 30082 and VSS/RTVI embeddings on 8017. |
| Production connection | Restricted `swiss-model` SSH tunnel maps the three services into the private application network. |

## Local application

Install and build the frontend, then start the API:

```bash
npm ci --prefix frontend
npm run build --prefix frontend
npm start
```

The default URL is `http://127.0.0.1:4318/`. Frontend development can use `npm run dev --prefix frontend` alongside the API.

A fresh clone has seeded example dossiers but not the operator's ignored databases or media. Model-backed features require `.env` values described by [`.env.example`](../.env.example). Keep every model, Supabase, email and backup credential server-side.

## Model connectivity

Since 24 September 2026, production sets `INFERENCE_PROVIDER=openai`, `INFERENCE_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1`, `INFERENCE_MODEL=gpt-6-luna` and `TRANSLATION_PROVIDER=openai`. The adapter in `server/model-endpoint.mjs` turns the shared request shape into a reasoning-model request:
- `max_completion_tokens` and `reasoning_effort`: `none` for short extraction steps, otherwise `INFERENCE_REASONING_EFFORT`, default `low`;
- no `temperature` and no `/no_think` marker;
- the key from `OPENAI_API_KEY`, which is set in the hosting panel only;
- no fallback to another provider;
- one retry on 429 or 5xx.

It meters token use against `MODEL_DAILY_BUDGET_USD` (priced by `INFERENCE_PRICE_INPUT_PER_M` and `INFERENCE_PRICE_OUTPUT_PER_M`, plus `WEB_SEARCH_PRICE`). When the budget is spent it returns `DAILY_CAPACITY_REACHED`. `node --env-file=.env scripts/probe-openai.mjs` checks every model step against the live API.

### Access and allowances

`ACCESS_POLICY` decides who may use the API:
- `open`: anyone (local and tests);
- `paid`: a verified account for every route that calls a model or sends email;
- `verified`: the whole app API.

Health, sign-in and the account's own routes always answer, and the frontend follows the policy reported by `/api/health`.

Verified means a confirmed email, or an OAuth identity that vouches for the address. Supabase "Confirm email" must be on.

Each account has `ASK_DAILY_LIMIT` / `ASK_WEEKLY_LIMIT` questions (20 / 100) and `TRANSLATE_DAILY_LIMIT` translations. They are stored in `data/pilot.sqlite`, and prepared answers don't count.

Rate limits are 120 reads and 20 writes a minute per account, and `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT` sign-in attempts a minute per address. `proxy.php` forwards the reader's address with `X-Proxy-Key` from `~/.swiss-proxy-key` on the shared hosting, and it must equal `PROXY_SHARED_SECRET`.

Rollback: set `ACCESS_POLICY=open` or `paid` and restart the container.

### GPU period (until 25 September 2026)

During the hackathon the application used OpenAI-compatible inference on the LaunchPad GPUs. Production then set:

```text
INFERENCE_MODEL=nvidia/nvidia-nemotron-nano-9b-v2
```

Translation and VSS use separate service URLs:

```text
TRANSLATION_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4320
VSS_EMBED_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4321
```

The production container resolves equivalent ports through `swiss-model-tunnel`. `deploy/switzerland/model-access.conf` restricts the dedicated no-shell account to local forwarding for 30081, 30082 and 8017, disables TTY/agent/X11/remote forwarding, and forces a non-interactive command. Do not reuse an operator key or expand the port allowlist casually.

Probe configured services without sending application evidence:

```bash
npm run probe:nvidia
```

Health only shows that an endpoint responded. It does not prove output quality, continuing availability or completion of an offline batch.

## Production release

Production uses `deploy/switzerland/compose.hostinger.yaml`. The Swiss application remains isolated from the existing midnight.vote root application and is mounted at `/Switzerland/`.

Release preparation follows these boundaries:

1. Build and test the application.
2. Build the frontend with `VITE_PUBLIC_PATH=/Switzerland/`, then run `scripts/prepare-swiss-release.mjs` (code, public data and semantic index archives). For a code-only update that leaves both data volumes untouched, `scripts/prepare-swiss-code-release.mjs` is enough.
3. Rehearse locally: `docker compose -f deploy/switzerland/compose.hostinger.yaml` with archives served from the host.
4. Verify archive hashes and excluded paths before upload.
5. Upload through the resumable release helper.
6. Start or update only the scoped Swiss service and verify `/Switzerland/api/health` plus representative API/browser paths.

### What the VPS fetches (23 September 2026 layout)

`scripts/prepare-swiss-release.mjs` emits three checksummed archives, staged under `Switzerland/bootstrap/<sha256>.tgz` for upload, and a `release.json` with their URLs and hashes:

| Archive | Contents | Compose variables |
|---|---|---|
| `backend.tgz` | `server/`, `config/`, `bootstrap.mjs`, `package.json`, `package-lock.json` | `APP_ARCHIVE_URL`, `APP_ARCHIVE_SHA256` |
| `public-data.tgz` | corpus database without import revision history, seed database with saved sources emptied, manifests, alignment receipts | `PUBLIC_DATA_URL`, `PUBLIC_DATA_SHA256` |
| `semantic-index.tgz` | int8 E5 index and the pinned ONNX query model | `SEMANTIC_INDEX_URL`, `SEMANTIC_INDEX_SHA256` |

The container launcher streams the backend archive into the `swiss-releases` volume, verifies it, runs `npm ci --omit=dev` once per release and starts `bootstrap.mjs`. The bootstrap streams each data archive to disk while hashing it, applies it once per checksum and never replaces `sessions.sqlite` or an existing `pilot.sqlite`. Nothing is held in memory, so a multi-gigabyte corpus fits a small container. Remove the archives from hosting once the VPS reports `bootstrap corpus: applied`.

Memory: 1.5 GB (`SWISS_MEM_LIMIT`, default) is enough with `HYBRID_RETRIEVAL=off`. Semantic search loads the 1.2 GB index and the query model, so set `HYBRID_RETRIEVAL=on` only with `SWISS_MEM_LIMIT=4g` (the 23 September rehearsal peaked at 3.1 GB with 3 GB allowed). `SEMANTIC_WORKERS` (default 2 in production) bounds the search threads, because a container sees the host's cores rather than its CPU quota. Disk: allow about 3× the corpus archive during the first bootstrap (archive, staging copy, previous files).

Model keys (`NVIDIA_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `TYPESAFE_API_KEY`) are set in the protected hosting environment, never in the compose file or the archives. With `NVIDIA_API_KEY` set, answers continue on NVIDIA's hosted catalog when the LaunchPad tunnel is gone; `INFERENCE_PROVIDER=nvidia-catalog` forces that route.

The public package may contain public parliamentary records, processing receipts, selected official media and source code. It must not contain `.env` files, private keys, session stores, account exports, feedback, service-role credentials or backup keys.

## Authentication and external providers

The application supports email/passwordless and password flows, persistent encrypted server sessions, refresh handling, account settings and MFA endpoints. Adapter code does not prove a provider is activated.

Follow [the authentication provider checklist](AUTH-PROVIDERS-CHECKLIST.md) for redirect URLs, branded email templates, sender configuration, Google enablement and real account lifecycle tests. Apple remains disabled without the required developer membership. Organization SSO is out of the current product scope.

## Public-corpus backup and recovery

Public corpus backup is separate from private account backup:

```bash
node scripts/backup-public-corpus.mjs
node scripts/restore-public-corpus.mjs <archive>
```

The public backup encrypts allowed files with AES-256-GCM, verifies authenticated decryption before publication and rejects unexpected restore paths. Configure `CORPUS_BACKUP_KEY_FILE` and `CORPUS_BACKUP_DIRECTORY` using protected persistent storage. Keep the encryption key under separate recovery custody and copy archives to independently controlled off-device storage.

Application-row backup excludes secrets and sessions. A restore requires an explicit Supabase target and protected service-role credential; preserving row IDs does not recreate missing authentication users. Do not enable scheduled privileged backup work without operator approval and a restore rehearsal.

## Monitoring and failure behavior

- `/api/health` reports configured application modes, not a semantic model evaluation.
- Provider timeouts and invalid model output return explicit unavailable states.
- The application can continue serving original public records when GPU services are down.
- Processing job failures stay in their ledgers and can be retried; they are not counted as complete.
- Session refresh failure must preserve the previous validated snapshot.
- The H100 LaunchPad allocation is temporary infrastructure. Tunnel restart handling cannot extend that allocation.

## Stance evaluation

[`config/evaluation/stance-cases.json`](../config/evaluation/stance-cases.json) holds 27 questions (7 EN, 7 FR, 7 DE, 6 IT) on seven 2024–2026 popular initiatives and the EFTA–Mercosur agreement. Each case lists speakers whose position the Official Bulletin states without ambiguity, with the quoted sentence and passage ID so anyone can check it. [`scripts/evaluate-stances.mjs`](../scripts/evaluate-stances.mjs) asks every question through the live answer pipeline in-process, the way `scripts/prepare-answers.mjs` does (prepared answers, web research and access control off). It needs the corpus in `data/parliament.sqlite`.

```bash
node --env-file=.env scripts/evaluate-stances.mjs --provider=openai                  # all cases on gpt-6-luna
node --env-file=.env scripts/evaluate-stances.mjs --provider=openai --only=en-10m-debate,fr-10m-buffat
node --env-file=.env scripts/evaluate-stances.mjs --provider=openai --judge=openai   # LLM verdict for mentions the rules cannot place
node scripts/evaluate-stances.mjs --rescore=data/evaluations/stances-<timestamp>.json # score stored answers again, no model calls
node scripts/evaluate-stances.mjs --check                                             # validate the cases file
```

Scoring is deterministic ([`scripts/lib/stance-score.mjs`](../scripts/lib/stance-score.mjs)). For each expected speaker the answer names, it reads the side from cues in that speaker's own clause ("supports", "opponents such as", "soutient", "lehnt … ab", "respinge", in four languages), then from the section title ("What opponents argued", "Arguments des partisans", "Argumente der Gegner"). A counter-proposal is never read as the proposal. A mention it cannot place stays unclassified. `--judge=openai` sends only those mentions to gpt-6-luna (Responses API, strict JSON output). The table goes to stdout, and every verdict with its sentence, cue, answer text and citations goes to `data/evaluations/stances-<timestamp>.json`.

| Result | Exit code | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| FLIP | 1 | The answer places a speaker on the side opposite to the quoted record, or puts a speaker who took no side on one. Fix the pipeline (synthesis prompt, retrieval), not the case. |
| ROLE | 1 | A member of Parliament presented as the Federal Council ("Federal Councillor Buffat", "Buffat, on behalf of the Federal Council"), a paragraph that speaks as the Federal Council while citing only members' speeches, or a Federal Councillor presented as a member. |
| FORBIDDEN | 1 | A phrase the case rules out, such as "the Federal Council supports the initiative". |
| NOT CITED, STATUS, unclassified | 0 (warn) | The named speaker was not cited, the answer came back degraded (refusal, sources only, replay), or the wording could not be placed. Read it; it is not a failure. |
| no answers | 2 | No case returned an answer, so nothing was measured. Check the model settings. |

The rules are conservative, and each verdict shows the sentence and cue behind it. If a FLIP is a misreading, add the phrasing to `server/tests/evaluate-stances.test.mjs` and fix the scorer. Add cases only from passages where the stance is explicit. Leave out rapporteurs who speak only for their committee, and speakers whose stance is only on a counter-proposal.

## Release acceptance

Before a production update, run:

```bash
npm run docs:check
npm test
npm run test:api --prefix frontend
npm run test:sites --prefix frontend
npm run build --prefix frontend
```

Then verify on the scoped public mount:

- health and static assets;
- both 200/46-seat chamber snapshots;
- one original-text read/search flow;
- one supported cited answer and one unsupported refusal;
- translation failure as well as success;
- bounded video behavior and disclosure;
- anonymous versus signed-in persistence;
- feedback failure handling without leaking conversation context.

Record live-provider results with a date. Do not turn a single successful smoke test into a service-level guarantee.
